2.The Landing page has been implemented with text structured by a flex. It fades out as we scroll down.
3.The next page on scrolling is a video that autoplays, when hovering over the video the cursor changes to a circle with text push.
4.Below the video is a grid having 4 vertical columns, the first three are Brand, Product and Motion. When hovered the arrow on each column rotates respectively with animation, the background of that column turns from black to white and its respective video starts playing in the fourth column. Text also fades in from the bottom when hovered.
5. The Fourth column has a circle of letters that move in a circle forever, whenever you take your mouse into the circle the ball at the center of the cricle changes colour and starts following the cursor, when the mouse leaves the circle the ball returns to its orignal position and colour.
